MOSFET Simulation

Simulation of MOSFETs based on the simplified all-region model.

Model Features:
	1. Effectively Mobility Dependence on Bias
	2. Channel-length Modulation
	3. Velocity Saturation
	4. Short-channel and Narrow-channel Effects
	5. Function is continuous

Model Exclusions:
	1. Temperature Dependence (300K Operation)
	2. Leakage Currents
